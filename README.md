# Market Recommendation for a New Product
Brief Summary

The premise is that we are promoting a new cup made of reusable materials into an existing (mock) market. We need to find out which types of shops among local businessess in which to market the new cup. The shops in the market are as follows:

    Cafe
    Coffee shop
    Espresso shop
    Others

1. coffee.csv - the fictional dataset to be explored
2. notebook.ipynb - the jupyter notebook file with code and breakdown of the logic behind the decisions made
3. figure_x.png - where x is an integer. These are plot output files.
4. shops_to_target.csv - this is the output file shortlisting shops to target for the next phase in marketing/sales
